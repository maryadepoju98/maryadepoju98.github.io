Microwave Example:
Whirlpool Over-the-Range Household Microwave Oven Model: WMH301017FS
Issues:
After a weeks’ worth observations these are some of the issues I have with my current microwave:
-	There is no express time feature. To enter 5 minutes the user must manually click the numbers 5, 0, 0.
-	There is no volume control or a way to silence the compete signal.
-	A lot of popcorn brands will tell you to NOT use the popcorn feature that comes with the microwave. 
Common Uses:
-	Heating my food
-	Defrosting my chicken
-	Melting butter
-	Softening cream cheese
-	Popping popcorn
Uncommon Use:
-	Conditioning my wig
 The microwave already has buttons set to these features. 
Common Sequence:
1.	Open the microwave
2.	Put object in microwave 
a.	Depending on the microwave put microwave cover or don’t
3.	Close the microwave 
4.	Select desired feature
a.	Depending on the feature it could be cook, defrost, popcorn
Common Mistakes:
-	Common mistakes that me and my roommate make is assuming that the microwave has an express mode. When there is an express mode the users just have to click the number and that represent the x amount of minutes the food will microwave. Our microwave does not have this feature so at time we put the food in the microwave click a number and walk away thinking the microwave has started. 

Suggestions:
-	Addition of express mode
-	Addition of sensor cook
-	Addition of signal volume control
